# Strategy

Generally the higher parking lots and sticking to summer trails below 2100m will get you the best skiing  for the least pain. Forests, boulder fields and lower elevation avalanche paths usually ski poorly.  Sometimes early season snowfalls are warm falling as rain at lower elevations.  There might be great skiing at treeline but little snow in the parking lot.
